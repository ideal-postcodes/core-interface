### Code Refactoring

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **Version 2:** - Package now exports a `defaults` object
- Client.defaults has been removed
- All client config is now stored in `client.config`
- All resources have been removed from the client. Instead retrieve
these from the library and inject the client. E.g.
`client.postcodes.retrieve` becomes `postcodes.retrieve(client, ...)`
- Helper methods (like lookupPostcode, ping) have been removed from the client.
Instead retrieve these from teh library and inject the client. E.g.
`client.lookupPostcode` becomes `lookupPostcode(client, ...)`
* **Defaults:** Uppercased default variables no longer exported.
Instead `defaults` object is supplied
